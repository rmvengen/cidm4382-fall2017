# Assignment 2 JSON files

These are the JSON files using the airplane data


## Problems

The problem was the JSON validator did not like my takeoff json file. It showed error around line 38:
```
{
                  "weight" : "18000",
                "altitude" : "8000",
                "Vr" : "102",
                "V2" : "112"
             },
              {
                  "weight" : "18000",
                "altitude" : "10000",
                "Vr" : "103",
                "V2" : "111"
             
        },
        //at weight 20000
        {
            "weight" : "20000",
                "altitude" : "0",
                "Vr" : "105",
                "V2" : "115"
            },
            {
                "weight" : "20000",
                "altitude" : "2000",
                "Vr" : "106",
                "V2" : "114"
             },
             ```
