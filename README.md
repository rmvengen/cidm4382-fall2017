# Assignment 1 Pizza Locator

This is the Loc8r, with the added Pizza locator. It will give results for three pizza places in Canyon, TX.


## The Pizzeria Locator

The changes to Simon Holmes Chapter 4 include:

* Obtain Simon's chapter 4 code and git pull or download it.
* Modify the code to include an additional list page of three (3) select pizza restaurants in Amarillo and/or Canyon (this means another tab in the navigation for the pizza places)
* Modify the code to develop attributes for each restaurant (they will be different than what Simon uses for locations.
* Modify and/or Copy and Moidy the layout.jade, location-info.jade, and locations-list.jade files to accomplish these tasks.
* Since Simon is using a 3rd party Bootstrap theme, you should do so as well.  The results may not be what you expect, but I want you to experiment
* Create an additional mixin that will also shade the background of each item in the locations-list for your pizza restaurants different colors depending on their rating


## Problems

When using npm start an error message kept appearing; however, was able to fix it.

Also good to note how to get to the site
